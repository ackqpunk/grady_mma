        <h4>Judo Coach</h4>

            <li>Air Force General</li>
            <li>Over 50 years training experience</li>
            <li>4th Degree Blackbelt in Judo</li>

        <p>Judo, Self Defense</p>
        <div class="sectionTitle">Bio</div>
        <p>During and after World War II, Judo was the premier system taught in the US military for hand to hand combat. Athletes were sent to Japan by the US Air Force to become instructors. I started my training at military college (The Citadel) and became President of the Judo Club. My instructor was a top national competitor.
        </p><p>
        I entered the Air Force and attended pilot training where I received more Judo training, and wherever I was assigned, there was usually a Judo club. I have done over 50 years of Judo training. I hold the rank of third degree black belt in Judo and second degree black belt in JuJitsu. I have earned Gold and Silver medals in the National Masters Tournaments and took Bronze twice in International World Master Tournaments.
        </p><p>
        Most of my Judo career can be called Old School or traditional Judo, versus a better style called New School Judo. As my Judo skills evolved, it became apparent that Judo was taught incorrectly. It supposes to be effortless, make use of the opponents momentum, and centered around him being off-balance. What I saw was strong grips, muscle strength, and having a strong pull.
        </p><p>
        Then I met an instructor of New School, a scientific system for training Olympic athletes. It has the same biometrics as Olympic Boxing or Fencing, and is more efficient. It gets Judo back to where it was always supposed to be, a powerful, but effortless system where a smaller man can easily defeat a larger man.
        </p><p>
        I took this system and improved on how it is taught. I then tested it against to athletes, much younger, and larger than myself. I have fought Sambo Champions, European Judo Medalist, and Brazillian Jiu Jitsu competitors. I find New School Judo to be far superior and less strenuous on the back and knees.</p>
